# Space-Invader

- This project was the ultimate test of my knowledge in Python and PyGame.
- The goal was to be able to create one of my favorite games with the tools in hand: Python and Pygame. I wanted to see how well I could make something from a general concept and test my limit in Pygame.
- For me, this project was a great way to apply my skills in Object Oriented Programming. I could better understand how to manage components in a game and take advantage of the PyGame embedded classes.
- I would say the most exciting part of this project was improving the user-friendliness of the application. Every time I ran the program, I would think— “Oh, this game would be easier to play if I just added this!”. I ended up adding pause, exit, and sound buttons. This is the first game I have created that closely represents a complete functioning online application
